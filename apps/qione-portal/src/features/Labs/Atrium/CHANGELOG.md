# Changelog

All notable changes to Atrium will be documented in this file.

## [1.3.3] — 2026-03-21

### Added

- **Comments** — Reply to project updates and tasks from the dashboard or portal.
- **Client updates** — Clients can now post updates from the portal.
- **Tags & Labels** — Create org-wide labels in System Settings and assign them to projects, tasks, files, and clients. Filter projects by label on the projects list page. Colored badges display throughout the dashboard.
- **In-app notifications** — Real-time notification bell in the dashboard and portal with unread count, mark-as-read, and mark-all-read.
- **Push notifications** — Browser push notifications for project updates, task assignments, and comments via Web Push (VAPID). Service worker included.
- **CSV data export** — Download projects, invoices, people, and tasks as CSV files from their respective pages.

### Security

- **kysely** override `0.28.11` → `0.28.14` — fixes two SQL injection vulnerabilities (CVE-2026-32763, CVE-2026-33468)
- **fast-xml-parser** override `5.4.1` → `5.5.7+` — fixes XML entity expansion (CVE-2026-33036) and input validation (CVE-2026-33349)

### Upgrade Notes

New database tables: `comment`, `label`, `project_label`, `task_label`, `file_label`, `member_label`, `notification`, `push_subscription`. New relation columns on `project`, `task`, `file`, and `member`. Docker handles this automatically via `prisma db push` in the entrypoint; bare-metal deployments must run `bun run db:push` after updating.

## [1.3.2] — 2026-03-21

### Added

#### Mobile-Responsive UI
- **Collapsible sidebar** — Slide-out hamburger menu on mobile with backdrop, auto-close on navigation
- **Adaptive project detail** — Collapsible `<details>` card for project metadata on mobile so tabs are immediately accessible
- **Responsive layouts** — Padding, tab bars, and flex layouts adapt across all dashboard and portal views
- **Responsive button labels** — "Upload Invoice" shortens to "Upload" on small screens

#### Testing
- Mobile navigation e2e tests (hamburger visibility, drawer open/close, route-change auto-close, desktop sidebar)

### Fixed
- Email errors in password reset and verification now propagate to the user instead of being silently swallowed
- Removed PII (email addresses) from error logs in onboarding controller
- Signup error logging now captures only `message` and `code` instead of full error object

### Security
- Next.js updated to 15.5.14 (patches CVE HTTP request smuggling + disk cache exhaustion)

## [1.3.1] — 2026-03-18

### Breaking Changes

- **Documents start as drafts** — Uploaded documents are no longer immediately visible to clients. Admins must click "Send to Client" (or use "Upload & Send") to make them visible. Existing pending documents are unaffected.
- **New version resets responses** — When an admin uploads a new version of a sent/signed document, all client responses and signatures are cleared and the document returns to "pending" for re-review. This enables scope change tracking but means clients must re-sign.
- **Unified upload flow** — The separate "Upload File" button is removed. All uploads go through the document modal (title, type, optional signature/approval). For quick file shares, use type "Other" and hit "Upload & Send".

### Added

#### Document Lifecycle
- **Draft status** — Documents start as drafts, invisible to clients until explicitly sent
- **Send workflow** — `Send to Client` transitions draft → pending and notifies clients via email
- **Void documents** — Cancel sent documents with optional reason; clients see read-only "Voided" badge
- **Audit trail** — Every document action (created, sent, viewed, signed, voided, expired) logged with timestamp, user, IP, and user agent. Viewable from the dashboard

#### E-Signature Enhancements
- **Field types** — Signature, date (auto-fill), initials, text input, and select (radio options) fields
- **Signing order** — Sequential signing enforcement; locked fields show "Waiting..." until prior signers complete
- **Signer assignment** — Assign specific fields to specific project clients
- **Admin signing** — Admins/owners can sign documents directly from the dashboard
- **Type-to-sign default** — Signature pad now defaults to type mode (draw still available)

#### Expiration & Reminders
- **Document expiration** — Set expiry (7/14/30/60/90 days) when sending; auto-expired by hourly cron
- **Automatic reminders** — Email reminders to unresponsive clients at configurable intervals (1-7 days)

#### Direct Signing Links
- **Access tokens** — Generate secure signing links for clients (SHA-256 hashed, time-limited)
- **Public signing page** — `/portal/sign/[token]` renders signing UI without portal login
- **Token revocation** — Admins can revoke individual signing links
- **Token cleanup** — Daily cron deletes expired tokens older than 30 days

#### Completion Certificate
- **PDF certificate** — Auto-generated completion certificate with document info, signer table, and full audit trail
- **Download** from both dashboard and portal when document is fully signed

#### Client Choices
- **Question with options** — Attach a question with radio button choices to any document; client must select one

#### UI Improvements
- **Unified Files tab** — Documents and files merged into single "Files" tab with one Upload button
- **Simplified upload modal** — Progressive disclosure: title + type + file upfront, signature checkbox for PDFs, advanced options collapsed
- **Upload & Send** — Primary CTA sends immediately; Save Draft for preparation
- **Auto-populate title** from filename on file selection
- **Three-tier action bar** — Primary action (solid button), secondary actions (icon group), destructive actions (right-aligned, danger on hover)
- **Continuous PDF scroll** — All pages render in a scrollable view with lazy loading via IntersectionObserver
- **Voided/expired states** in portal — Read-only badges, no action buttons

#### Document Versioning
- **Version history** — Upload new file versions to any document (draft or sent). Previous versions preserved with uploader name and timestamp
- **Restore versions** — Restore any previous version with one click; creates a new version entry for traceability
- **Scope change tracking** — Uploading a new version on a sent document resets to "pending" so clients re-review the changes
- **Version badge** — Documents with multiple versions show a "v2", "v3" etc. badge

#### Direct Signing Links
- **Generate signing links** — Create secure, time-limited signing URLs for specific clients from the dashboard
- **Manage links** — View active links, copy URLs, and revoke links per document
- **Token security** — SHA-256 hashed tokens, rate-limited public endpoints, auto-cleanup of expired tokens

#### Email Templates
- `DocumentReminderEmail` — Reminder for unresponsive clients with optional expiry date
- `DocumentSigningTurnEmail` — "Your turn to sign" notification for sequential signing

#### Testing
- 82 unit tests for `DocumentsService` covering all business logic paths
- 13 new E2E API tests (send, void, audit trail, field locking, token generation, expiry validation)

### Fixed
- Certificate page overflow — audit trail now properly spans multiple pages
- Token endpoint response filtered — no internal IDs exposed to unauthenticated users
- Signature fields locked on sent documents — prevents editing after clients have signed
- `requiresSignature` enforced as PDF-only on the API
- Send blocked for signature documents with zero fields placed
- `expiresInDays` validated on send endpoint (1-365 range)
- Signing audit events logged synchronously for compliance
- Notification type safety — removed unsafe `as any` cast
- `fetchSigningInfo` stale closure fixed in signing viewer

### Upgrade Notes

Schema changes require `bun run db:push`. **Data migration needed**: run `bun run packages/database/scripts/migrate-document-sent-at.ts` to backfill `sentAt` on existing pending documents. New tables: `document_audit_event`, `document_access_token`. New columns on `document` and `signature_field` models.

## [1.3.0] — 2026-03-17

### Added

- **Documents** — Upload quotes, contracts, and NDAs to projects. Clients review inline and accept/decline with optional reason. Admin sees status, decline reason, and can reset to re-request.
- **Decision tasks** — New task type where clients vote on options. Vote counts hidden until all clients have voted.
- **Activity feed** — Document responses and decision votes appear in the project updates timeline.
- **Email notifications** — Clients notified on document uploads, invoice uploads, and decision results. Admins notified on client responses.
- **Invoice uploads** — Upload PDF/image invoices as an alternative to itemized invoices.
- **Payment settings** — Configure payment instructions and method (bank transfer, PayPal, Stripe, other) with encrypted storage.
- **Portal UX** — Pending actions banner, badge counts on Files tab, confirmation dialog on accept/decline, inline document viewer modal.
- **Responsive layout** — Dashboard and portal stack vertically on small screens; tabs scroll, forms wrap.
- Configurable rate limiting via `THROTTLE_LIMIT` and `SIGNUP_THROTTLE_LIMIT` env vars.

### Fixed

- Portal invoice pagination now filters server-side by project (was client-side, broke page counts)
- Activity logging errors now logged instead of silently swallowed
- Tracker script injection hardened: `NEXT_PUBLIC_TRACKERS` validated against attribute whitelist
- React hydration mismatch (#418) suppressed on root elements

### Upgrade Notes

Additive schema changes only (new tables + nullable columns). No data migration needed. Docker entrypoint handles it automatically; manual deployments run `bun run db:push`.

## [1.2.1] — 2026-03-12

### Added
- Default Atrium logo on landing page and sidebar (falls back when no custom branding is set)
- "Hide logo" toggle in branding settings for orgs without a company logo
- Sidebar and portal header automatically reflect branding changes after save (no refresh needed)

### Fixed
- README image paths not rendering on GitHub (`public/` → `./public/`)

## [1.2.0] — 2026-03-11

### Added

#### Account Deletion
- Owners can delete their account and cascade-delete their organization (projects, files, invoices, clients)
- Password re-authentication required before deletion
- Type-to-confirm dialog requiring `DELETE <org name>`
- `GET /api/account/deletion-info` preflight endpoint returns org ownership context
- Clients (non-owners) can delete their own account from portal settings
- E2E tests for deletion flow, credential invalidation, and non-owner visibility

#### Supabase Row Level Security
- `enable-rls.sql` enables RLS on all 21 tables and revokes `anon`/`authenticated` access
- `bun run db:rls` command to apply manually
- Docker entrypoints apply RLS automatically when `SUPABASE=true`
- Safe for plain Postgres — gated behind env var, skipped by default

#### Docker
- Built-in PostgreSQL 16 bundled in the unified Docker image — no separate database container needed
- `USE_BUILT_IN_DB` toggle: set to `false` with a `DATABASE_URL` to use an external database
- Graceful shutdown of built-in PostgreSQL on container stop
- Docker Hub overview with quick start, Compose examples, and env var reference
- `scripts/update-dockerhub-readme.sh` to push Docker Hub description from `docker/DOCKERHUB.md`
- Docker deployment documentation (`docs/docker.md`)

#### Unraid
- Unraid Community Applications template with single-container setup
- Template repo at `Vibra-Labs/unraid-templates` linked as git submodule
- PR submitted to `selfhosters/unRAID-CA-templates` for CA listing

#### Invitations
- Accept-invite auto-login when a user signs up with an already-existing account
- Accept-invite sets active organization before redirect

#### UX
- Portal `/portal` redirects to `/portal/projects`
- Danger zone section visible to all dashboard users (owners and non-owners)

### Security
- Comprehensive security audit with findings documented in `SECURITY_AUDIT.md`
- DTO validation added for project and task inputs (`@IsDateString`, `@MaxLength`)
- Path traversal protection in local file storage (reject `..` in keys)
- Branding logo upload restricted to image MIME types
- Update attachment size validated against system settings before storage
- Caddyfile hardened with `X-Content-Type-Options`, `X-Frame-Options`, `Referrer-Policy` headers
- PostgreSQL port no longer exposed to host in production `docker-compose.yml`
- Generic password verification error message to prevent user enumeration
- `DELETED_USER_SENTINEL` constant in shared package for anonymized user references

### Changed
- Deploy workflow now only pushes to Docker Hub (removed Google Cloud Run and Firebase Hosting steps)
- Shared `setActiveOrgAndRedirect` helper replaces duplicated org-switch-and-redirect logic
- Organization deletion now purges file blobs from storage provider (not just DB records)

### Fixed
- Dockerfile missing `ca-certificates` package broke PostgreSQL apt repo setup

## [1.1.0] — 2026-03-09

### Added

#### Billing & Subscriptions
- Stripe integration with test/live mode toggle via `STRIPE_MODE`
- Subscription plans (Free, Pro, Lifetime) with DB-seeded configuration
- Checkout flow via Stripe Checkout Sessions
- Stripe Customer Portal for managing payment methods
- Webhook handler for checkout, subscription updates, invoice events
- Usage meters (projects, storage, team members, clients) on billing page
- Plan limit enforcement via `PlanGuard` and `@PlanLimit()` decorator
- Lifetime plan with seat cap tracking
- Lazy free plan initialization for orgs created before billing was enabled

#### Performance
- In-memory session cache (30s TTL) — reduces DB round trips from 8+ to 2 per page load
- Auth routes bypass and invalidate cache to prevent stale org context

### Fixed

- Auth controller uses `BETTER_AUTH_URL` for request origin instead of `WEB_URL`
- Session cache invalidation on auth mutations prevents 401 "Organization context required" errors
- Invoice update/delete mutations now scope Prisma queries to `organizationId` (prevents potential cross-org TOCTOU race)
- Browser autofill no longer overrides dark mode input backgrounds
- Sign-in button shows spinner during login

### Security

- Removed scripts containing hardcoded credentials
- Sanitized infrastructure docs (removed project IDs and service refs)
- GitHub Actions deploy workflow uses variables instead of hardcoded URLs
- Added `.firebase/`, `.firebaserc`, `firebase.json`, `*.pem`, `*.key` to `.gitignore`

### Database

- New models: `SubscriptionPlan`, `Subscription`
- Subscription linked to Organization (1:1) with Stripe customer/subscription IDs
- Plan features stored as string array, limits as integers (-1 = unlimited)

## [1.0.2] — 2026-03-02

### Security

- Profile form in portal settings

#### Email Verification
- Verification email sent on signup via Better Auth
- `/verify-email` page with verified/unverified states

- "Send Test Email" button to verify email config
- DB settings with env-var fallbacks: `DB setting → env var → default`

#### Setup Wizard
- 5-step first-run wizard at `/setup` for new organizations:
  1. Organization profile (name, logo, colors)
  2. Email configuration (None / Resend / SMTP with test send)
  3. Create first project
  4. Invite first client
  5. Completion summary
- Automatic redirect from dashboard for owners who haven't completed setup
- Steps 2-4 are skippable

#### Security
- CSRF protection via double-submit cookie pattern
- Auth secret validation — refuses to start in production with default secret
- File download authorization — members must be assigned to the project
- CSRF guard skips unauthenticated requests (no session = no CSRF risk)
- CSRF token auto-retry on first mutating request from the frontend

### Fixed

- Invitation email grammar: "You have been invited you" → "You have been invited"
- Welcome email template wired up (was dead code)
- Invoice number race condition — serializable transaction with P2002 retry
